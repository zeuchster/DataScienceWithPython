What is Machine Learning 
- Machine Learning s a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) which focusses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn
, gradually improving its accuracy

How is it different from Traditional Programming?
- Traditional Programming: Developers have to specify the patterns/rules in a data
- Macine Learning: Computers find the pattern in the data - this makes our job easy

Types of Machine Learning:
- Supervised (unlabed (x) & labeled (y) data)
- Unsupervised (unlabled (x) data only)
- Semi-Supervised (large volume of unlabed (x) & small volume of labeled (y) data)
- Re-inforcement (find a way to maximize rewards)
